## README for Plum Data Analysis

### Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to ticket resolution processes to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and visualization to provide insights and recommendations.

### Files Included

- **cleaned_data.csv**: The cleaned dataset used for analysis.
- **Plum Data Analysis.docx**: The document detailing the data analysis approach, steps, and findings.
- **Plum Analysis.py**: The Python script used for data analysis and visualization.

### Data Analysis Steps

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Load the dataset and examine its structure.
   - Identify key variables influencing ticket resolution (e.g., Group, Status, Priority, Resolution time, Satisfaction Score).

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values by imputation or removal.
   - Remove duplicate records.
   - Convert and encode categorical variables as needed.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to explore variable distributions and relationships.
   - Visualize resolution time distribution and trends.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Perform t-tests and ANOVA to assess differences in resolution times across groups or categories.
   - Explore correlations between resolution time and other variables.

5. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Summarize key findings and patterns.
   - Provide actionable recommendations for improving ticket resolution processes.

### Visualizations

The following visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

1. **Bar Chart for Status Distribution**:
   - Shows the count of different statuses.

2. **Bar Chart for Priority Distribution**:
   - Shows the count of different priority levels.

3. **Line Chart for Resolution Time Trends**:
   - Shows trends in resolution time over time.

4. **Histogram for Resolution Time Distribution**:
   - Shows the distribution of resolution times.

5. **Box Plot for Reopens Distribution**:
   - Shows the distribution of reopens.

6. **Stacked Bar Chart for Status and Priority**:
   - Shows the distribution of statuses and priorities.

7. **Time Series Analysis for Requester Wait Time**:
   - Shows trends in requester wait time over time.

8. **Heatmap for Correlation Analysis**:
   - Shows correlations between different variables.

### Key Insights

1. **Efficiency Analysis**:
   - Analyzed resolution time, reopens, and satisfaction scores.
   - Calculated and visualized average resolution time for different groups.

2. **Group Performance**:
   - Identified quick and slow groups in terms of resolution times.
   - Presented insights through a bar chart.

3. **Ticket Type Analysis**:
   - Analyzed resolution times for different ticket types.
   - Visualized findings using a bar chart.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, several recommendations were provided to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ticket resolution processes. These include optimizing processes for slower groups, addressing specific ticket types that take longer to resolve, and leveraging statistical insights to make data-driven decisions.

### Running the Analysis

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

2. **Execute the Script**:
   Run the `Plum Analysis.py` script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
   ```bash
   python Plum Analysis.py
   ```
